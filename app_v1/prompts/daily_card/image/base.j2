Create an abstract, neutral and atmospheric image that visually reflects the emotional tone, symbolic meaning and overall energy of the following text:

{{ chatGPT_answer }}

Image context:
Wallpaper, Daily Mood, Abstract Energy, Arcana: {{ arcana_name }}

Guidelines:
— Abstract composition only  
— No text, no letters, no numbers, no readable symbols  
— No detailed human portraits or faces  
— Avoid literal illustrations; use visual metaphors  
— The image should derive its mood, dynamics and emotional weight strictly from the provided text and arcana name  

Visual interpretation:
— Translate emotions, rhythm, tension or calmness of the text into shapes, colors, light and composition  
— Allow the arcana to influence the image symbolically, not literally  
— No predefined mood: let the image be shaped entirely by the content above  

Aesthetic:
— Minimalist, modern, aesthetically balanced  
— Soft or dramatic lighting depending on the text  
— Cohesive color palette guided by the emotional tone  
— Suitable as a phone wallpaper (calm focal point, no visual noise)  

The image should feel like a visual echo of the text — intuitive, silent, and emotionally aligned.
